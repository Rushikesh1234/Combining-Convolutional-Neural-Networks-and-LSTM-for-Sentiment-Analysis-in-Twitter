# Combining-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-LSTM-for-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Twitter

• Worked on Twitter dataset for performing Sentiment analysis in three categories – Positive, Negative and Neutral.
• Worked on Data Preprocessing for filtering accurate and meaningful words by removing unnecessary words/characters, by doing tokenization and POS tagging, using some stop wards and stem.
• Used Word embedding (Google’s Glove model) technique to emphasize data in more elaborative way which helps to gain good accuracy.
• Implemented sentiment analysis using the combination of CNN and LSTM models to get accurate result and compared these models with other ML model such as the Naïve Bayes, SVM, Logistic regression, LSTM, CNN.
• Tools – Google Colab, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Keras, NLTK, JavaScript, ReactJS
